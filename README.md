## Usage
### **Secure Boot MUST** be disabled, otherwise it interferes with the permission of the script to read/write to EC file.

# How To Install GUI app?
- Download the .zip from the github and extract it wherever you want.
- Mark the file ```at_startup.sh``` as executable.
- Open terminal inside the extracted folder and run ```sudo ./at_startup.sh``` .
- This will install all the dependencies which are missing and open the GUI app for the first time.
  - If the ```GUI did not open``` or ```something seems to not work``` follow the steps below:
  - Disable the Secure Boot
  - Manually install Python Libraries like
    - pip
    - subprocess
    - signal
    - webbrowser
    - fileinput
    - threading
    - os
    - math
    - psutil
    - warnings
    - tkinter
  - Check whether your Linux Kernal has ```ec_sys``` support.
      - If ```no``` then copy the file from inside the [DOWNLOADED ZIP] ```modprobe.d``` and ```modules-lode.d``` to [SYSTEM] ```etc/modprobe.d/``` and ```etc/modules-load.d/ec_sys.conf```, then restart.
      - If ```yes``` then add ```ec_sys write_support = 1``` line in file ```/etc/default/grub```, save and in terminal run command ```update-grub``` then reboot.
- App will create ```conf.txt``` file. it will contain all your configurations and fan curve values. deleting that file will reset all your fan curves.

# Updating 
- Just delete the older folder and work in a new folder.

## Bugs
- Advanced fan profile seems to have a lower RPM than set in GUI.

## Issue format
- Find if there is already an issue avilable for your ```LINUX DISTRO```. and comment your issue inside that with steps below.
  - If your ```LINUX DISTRO``` is not listed then make a issue with heading exactly as below.
    - ```LINUX DISTRO``` issue!
- Specify the System Specifications [CPU, GPU] and Model Number [MSI GP76 11UG] while reporting the issue.
- Write the problem with some description.
- Attach relevant screenshots.
